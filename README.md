# Shell Scripting Examples

Welcome to the Shell Scripting Examples repository! This space is dedicated to helping you learn and master the art of shell scripting, providing a variety of scripts ranging from basic to advanced levels.

## Description

Shell scripting is a powerful tool for automating tasks in Unix-like operating systems. The scripts are written in a scripting language interpreted by a shell, which is a command-line interpreter. The most common shell is Bash (Bourne Again SHell), but there are others like Zsh, Sh, and Fish.

This repository contains a collection of shell script examples to demonstrate best practices, common patterns, and useful techniques. The scripts are categorized by their complexity and use case, making it easy for you to find what you need.
